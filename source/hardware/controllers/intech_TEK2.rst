Intech Studio - Grid (TEK2)
===========================

-  `Intech Studio <https://intech.studio/>`__

.. versionadded:: 2.4

TEK2 and Scratch
----------------

This simple configuration is created for the Intech Studio `TEK2 module <https://intech.studio/shop/tek2>`__, 
enabling the use of the Jogwheel and Scratch functionality in MIXXX software. 
Our Grid modules are modular and fully configurable, allowing you to create your own DJ MIDI controller.
We typically use the `TEK2 <https://intech.studio/shop/tek2>`__, `PBF4 <https://intech.studio/shop/pbf4>`__, and `PO16 <https://intech.studio/shop/po16>`__ modules, which together form a straightforward combination to control any DJ software. 
However, everyone's needs and ideas for plug together Grids are different, 
so creating custom mappings in MIXXX is entirely up to youâ€”it's really easy!

Setting up the controller
-------------------------

To make this mapping work, follow these settings:

1. Download and open the `Grid Editor <https://intech.studio/ae/products/grid-editor/>`__.
2. In the Grid Editor, access the Profile Cloud where you can load and save configurations to our Modules.
3. Search for 'TEK2 DJ setup', then load and store it to your TEK2.
4. Open up MIXXX, go to Preferences/Controllers, and select the 'Intech TEK2' profile.

That's it! You are now able to use the jog wheel and create your custom mapping.
